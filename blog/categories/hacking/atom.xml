    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new season of <a href="http://layertennis.com">Layer Tennis</a> started up last night (after a four year hiatus) with two exhibition matches. Layer Tennis is a continuation of an <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Photoshop+Tennis">earlier tradition</a>, perhaps born on usenet, where two designers toss images back &amp; forth in a public forum, playing off of each other&rsquo;s work for competition and entertainment.</p>

<p>I have neither training nor inclination towards design, but I do have enough interest in the subject to drive me to compulsively refresh in anticipation of the next volley.  There is something appealing about watching two artists locked in an exchange within tight constraints while a third participant – a writer with an expert eye – provides play-by-play and color commentary.  While I was enjoying yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kleon vs. Anderson&rdquo; match I started to think about the difficulties of orchestrating similar high jinks in the programming world.</p>

<p>There are ten volleys, and each combatant has a budget of a mere 15 minutes to deliver the next blow.  I can&rsquo;t be certain, but I imagine that the entire event is time-delayed 15 minutes to give the commentator a similar budget of time to deliver their observations to the audience. I believe that there are deliberately very few rules, other than the dimensions of the resulting image and an obligation to somehow incorporate elements of the prior image. They otherwise appear free to use any tool at their disposal: paper, found objects, knives, cameras, scanners, and of course software.</p>

<p>A naive translation into a competitive event between two programmers would keep the 15 minute constraint, and the total number of volleys. I think this would be essential, because it really does need to be an event that would play out in an afternoon.</p>

<p>The constraint that the image be a standard size could be translated into a push to a git repository. This would provide a natural way for the audience to observe the match.</p>

<p>The final rule – that the sparring partners are not allow to ignore each other – needs no translation, but there are some interesting possibilities: you can call a function or use a structure defined by your opponent. Or, alternatively, it might be acceptable to refactor it in some way that preserves some recognizable aspect. Or maybe a volley would be returned with another program that uses some part of the prior volley as input, or produces some part of it as output.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to say that there should be no additional rules, in order to maximize creative liberties. However, we might want to impose an additional constraint that the result is runnable.</p>

<p>As I imagine what it might be like to participate in such an event, I find the most terrifying rule to be the 15-minute time limit. The results would likely be much less impressive than the images in Layer Tennis. Expect the match to look nothing like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_scene">demo scene</a>. Instead, expect something closer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">Fizz Buzz</a> end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m playing, that is. I would love to see what some of the more talented hackers could do under such tight pressure.</p>
