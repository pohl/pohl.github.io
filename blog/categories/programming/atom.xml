    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By the end of <a href="http://screaming.org/blog/2014/08/15/lets-build-a-browser-engine-in-swift/">part one</a>
of this series we had a rudimentary document object model for representing only a tiny subset of the universe of possible HTML documents.
This installment, modelled after the <a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/11/toy-layout-engine-2.html">second post</a> in Matt Brubeck&rsquo;s series, implements an equally modest HTML parser that
will build instances of the model we defined last time.</p>

<p>Our parser, just like our model, directly mirrors the design of Matt&rsquo;s implementation in Rust. The primary
challenge is just one of translating between two languages. Open <a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/11/toy-layout-engine-2.html">Matt&rsquo;s post</a> in
another browser window to compare the Swift code below to the original Rust.</p>

<p>The first thing we need is a type to represent parsing state: the input string and the index of the
next unprocessed character. Immediately this gets us into the differences between how Rust and Swift
implement strings. Both languages need to handle the complexity of Unicode while being as efficient and
safe as possible. In Rust our index was a <code>uint</code> that indexes into an <code>&amp;str</code> slice created from the <code>String</code>.  In Swift, we
can index directly into the String, but our index type is a <code>String.Index</code> struct with a <code>succesor()</code> method that handles
the complexity of stepping from character to character without accidentally stepping into the middle of one that has a multi-byte representation.</p>

<p>```
struct Parser {</p>

<pre><code>var pos: String.Index
let input: String
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Notice that since the input string doesn&rsquo;t change, we can use a <code>let</code> binding for it. The index, on the other hand, changes as we parse the document, which requires us to use <code>var</code>. Now that
we have this type defined, we can implement a few foundational methods.</p>

<p>```
extension Parser {</p>

<pre><code>// Read the current Character without consuming it.
func nextCharacter() -&gt; Character {
    return input[self.pos]
}

// Does the current input start with the given string?
func startsWith(s: String) -&gt; Bool {
    return self.input.substringFromIndex(self.pos).hasPrefix(s)
}

// Return true if all input is consumed.
func eof() -&gt; Bool {
    return self.pos &gt;= self.input.endIndex
}

// ...
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>These methods look very much like the Rust equivalents. The most obvious difference is that the references to <code>self</code> are explicitly declared in Rust but are implicit in Swift.</p>

<p>Next we come to the place where the <code>successor()</code> method of <code>String.Index</code> allows us to safely advance to the next Unicode <code>Character</code>. This is the first method that mutates parsing state. Notice how the <code>&amp;mut self</code> in the Rust implementation is replaced by the <code>mutating</code> keyword in Swift.</p>

<p>```
// Return the current Character, and advance self.pos to the next Character.
mutating func consumeCharacter() &ndash;> Character {</p>

<pre><code>let result = input[self.pos]
self.pos = self.pos.successor()
return result
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The next method is the heart of the parser. It consumes characters one by one for as long as the predicate function evaluates to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p><code>``
// Consume Character until</code>test` returns false.
mutating func consumeWhile(test: Character &ndash;> Bool) &ndash;> String {</p>

<pre><code>var result = ""
while !self.eof() &amp;&amp; test(self.nextCharacter()) {
    result.append(consumeCharacter())
}
return result
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>At this point in Matt&rsquo;s post, we would be defining a pair of methods using the one above. Both of these methods, however, want to pass predicates that test character set membership.  This is something that required a little gymnastics due to an apparent impedence mismatch between the native Swift <code>Character</code> type and the <code>NSCharacterSet</code> class, whose <code>characterIsMember</code> method requires a <code>unichar</code>. I was unable to find an easy way to convert one to another directly. Fortunately, <code>NSString</code> was a useful stepping stone between the two.</p>

<p>```
extension Character {</p>

<pre><code>func isMemberOf(set: NSCharacterSet) -&gt; Bool {
    let bridgedCharacter = (String(self) as NSString).characterAtIndex(0)
    return set.characterIsMember(bridgedCharacter)
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Using this workaround we can implement the desired methods:</p>

<p>```
// Consume and discard zero or more whitespace Character.
mutating func consumeWhitespace() {</p>

<pre><code>self.consumeWhile( {$0.isMemberOf(NSCharacterSet.whitespaceCharacterSet()) })
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>// Parse a tag or attribute name.
mutating func parseTagName() &ndash;> String {</p>

<pre><code>return self.consumeWhile( {$0.isMemberOf(NSCharacterSet.alphanumericCharacterSet()) })
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Now we finally get to finally write some functions that produce nodes in our object model.</p>

<p>```
// Parse a single node.
mutating func parseNode() &ndash;> Node {</p>

<pre><code>switch self.nextCharacter() {
    case "&lt;": return self.parseElement()
    case _: return self.parseText()
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>// Parse a text node.
mutating func parseText() &ndash;> Node {</p>

<pre><code>return Node(data: self.consumeWhile({$0 != "&lt;" }))
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The function that produces a <code>Node</code> that represents an HTML element looks like the Rust equivalent. I like the assertions, so I kept them even though I worry that this code will fail to consume the characters in release builds. I have yet to test that.</p>

<p>```
// Parse a single element, including its open tag, contents, and closing tag.
mutating func parseElement() &ndash;> Node {</p>

<pre><code>// Opening tag.
assert(self.consumeCharacter() == "&lt;")
let tagName = self.parseTagName()
let attrs = self.parseAttributes()
assert(self.consumeCharacter() == "&gt;")

// Contents.
let children = self.parseNodes()

// Closing tag.
assert(self.consumeCharacter() == "&lt;")
assert(self.consumeCharacter() == "/")
assert(self.parseTagName() == tagName)
assert(self.consumeCharacter() == "&gt;")

return Node(name: tagName, attrs: attrs, children: children)
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This is also a possible concern in two of the three methods for parsing HTML element attributes and values.</p>

<p>```
// Parse a single name=&ldquo;value&rdquo; pair.
mutating func parseAttr() &ndash;> (String, String) {</p>

<pre><code>let name = self.parseTagName()
assert(self.consumeCharacter() == "=")
let value = self.parseAttrValue()
return (name, value)
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>// Parse a quoted value.
mutating func parseAttrValue() &ndash;> String {</p>

<pre><code>let openQuote = self.consumeCharacter()
assert(openQuote == "\"" || openQuote == "'")
let value = self.consumeWhile( {$0 != openQuote} )
assert(self.consumeCharacter() == openQuote)
return value
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>// Parse a list of name=&ldquo;value&rdquo; pairs, separated by whitespace.
mutating func parseAttributes() &ndash;> AttrMap {</p>

<pre><code>var attributes: AttrMap = [:]
while (true) {
    self.consumeWhitespace()
    if self.nextCharacter() == "&gt;" {
        break
    }
    let (name, value) = self.parseAttr()
    attributes[name] = value
}
return attributes
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Before we can write the top-level method that parses an entire document, we need the method that parses a set of sibling nodes.</p>

<p>```
// Parse a sequence of sibling nodes.
mutating func parseNodes() &ndash;> [Node] {</p>

<pre><code>var nodes: [Node] = []
while (true) {
    self.consumeWhitespace()
    if self.eof() || self.startsWith("&lt;/") {
        break
    }
    nodes.append(self.parseNode())
}
return nodes
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Using the above, we can write the final method to parse a document.</p>

<p>```
// Parse an HTML document and return the root element.
public func parse(source: String) &ndash;> Node {</p>

<pre><code>var parser = Parser(pos: source.startIndex, input: source)
let nodes = parser.parseNodes()
// If the document contains a root element, just return it. Otherwise, create one.
if nodes.count == 1 {
    return nodes[0]
} else {
    return Node(name: "html", attrs: [:], children: nodes)
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pohl/Crow">Crow</a> project also contains some unit tests to exercise this, which means we have finally arrived at a place where we can pull the trigger and see something happen.</p>

    <id>http://pohl.github.io/blog/2014/08/15/lets-build-a-browser-engine-in-swift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The disembodied head of Matt Brubeck over at <a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/">limpet.net</a> has been producing an excellent series of blog posts chronicling the exercise of creating a toy layout engine for a web browser. Matt works for Mozilla on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_(layout_engine)">Servo</a>, which is about as close to the bright center of the universe as any open source project is these days. He has taken on this exercise to bolster his own mental model of how layout engines work – so that he can more effectively contribute to Servo – and, apparently, to motivate others to share the journey.</p>

<p>Do go read <a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html">Matt&rsquo;s first post</a> in the series. He does a fabulous job of explaining the goal and its motivation, and of setting expectations for the scope of the effort. Even if you are not interested in doing this particular exercise, you might find that the way that he thinks about setting up the challenge will help you in other pursuits.</p>

<p>Matt has chosen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a> as the programming language for this exercise, largely because Servo is written in it. 2014 has been an exciting year for emerging programming languages, and Rust may be the single most exhilarating one. However, I have been on a bit of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a> kick[1] as of late, so I chose to use this as an opportunity to both learn how browser sausage is made and to practice some Swift.  My own toy project is called <a href="https://github.com/pohl/Crow">Crow</a>.</p>

<p>I was going to put a litany of caveats here, but I decided to spare you. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

<h2>First Step: The Central Model</h2>

<p>The central data model for a browser is a tree of nodes representing the HTML document. Of course there is a <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org">detailed specification</a> that spells out what a real implementation needs to be like. This is just a learning exercise, so simplicity is a higher priority than completeness.</p>

<p>This might be a good time to <a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html">open Matt&rsquo;s article</a> in another browser window so you can compare his Rust implementation to the Swift below.</p>

<p>First we need a <code>Node</code> type so we can build the DOM tree. I&rsquo;m going to try to use <code>let</code> bindings where I can because I have grown to appreciate immutability wherever I can get it. Each node has a <code>NodeType</code>, and can also have any number of children.</p>

<p>```
public struct Node {</p>

<pre><code>// data common to all nodes:
public let children: [Node]
// data specific to each node type:
public let nodeType: NodeType
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Just like Matt&rsquo;s toy project, the <code>NodeType</code> is represented as an <code>enum</code>. There are two possible cases here: either the node represents an HTML element concomitant with tag name and a set of attributes, or it represents a string of characters between HTML tags.</p>

<p>```
public enum NodeType {</p>

<pre><code>case Element(ElementData)
case Text(String)
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>When a <code>NodeType</code> represents an HTML element, it needs a data structure to hold the tag name and the attributes. The attributes are represented as a <code>Dictionary&lt;String,String&gt;</code>. Like Matt, we&rsquo;ll make a type alias for that:</p>

<p>```
public struct ElementData {</p>

<pre><code>public let tagName: String
public let attributes: AttrMap
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>public typealias AttrMap = [String:String]</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Finally, Matt offers a pair of <code>Node</code> constructor functions for making instances. Swift has special syntax for constructors, but it does allow us to define them separately from the <code>struct</code> in an <code>extension</code> block.</p>

<p>```
extension Node {</p>

<pre><code>public init(data: String) {
    self.children = []
    self.nodeType = .Text(data)
}

public init(name: String, attrs: AttrMap, children: [Node]) {
    self.children = children
    let data = ElementData(tagName: name, attributes: attrs)
    self.nodeType = .Element(data)
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the humble beginnings. Matt offers some ideas for further exercise in his post – and some links to other resources around the web – so you might want to check those out.</p>

<p>Next time I&rsquo;ll take on the simple HTML parser that builds an actual tree out of the pieces above.</p>

    <link href="http://pohl.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/source-pong/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-09T12:23:17-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://pohl.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/source-pong</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new season of <a href="http://layertennis.com">Layer Tennis</a> started up last night (after a four year hiatus) with two exhibition matches. Layer Tennis is a continuation of an <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Photoshop+Tennis">earlier tradition</a>, perhaps born on usenet, where two designers toss images back &amp; forth in a public forum, playing off of each other&rsquo;s work for competition and entertainment.</p>

<p>I have neither training nor inclination towards design, but I do have enough interest in the subject to drive me to compulsively refresh in anticipation of the next volley.  There is something appealing about watching two artists locked in an exchange within tight constraints while a third participant – a writer with an expert eye – provides play-by-play and color commentary.  While I was enjoying yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kleon vs. Anderson&rdquo; match I started to think about the difficulties of orchestrating similar high jinks in the world of programming.</p>

<p>There are ten volleys, and each combatant has a budget of a mere 15 minutes to deliver the next blow.  I can&rsquo;t be certain, but I imagine that the entire event is time-delayed 15 minutes to give the commentator a similar budget of time to deliver their observations to the audience. I believe that there are deliberately very few rules, other than the dimensions of the resulting image and an obligation to somehow incorporate elements of the prior image. They otherwise appear free to use any tool at their disposal: paper, found objects, knives, cameras, scanners, and of course software.</p>

<p>A naive translation into a competitive event between two programmers would keep the 15 minute constraint, and the total number of volleys. I think this would be essential, because it really does need to be an event that would play out in an afternoon.</p>

<p>The constraint that the image be a standard size could be translated into a push to a git repository. This would provide a natural way for the audience to observe the match.</p>

<p>The final rule – that the sparring partners are not allowed to ignore each other – needs no translation.  Programming does bring some interesting spin, however. You could call a function or use a structure defined by your opponent. Or, alternatively, it might be acceptable to refactor it in some way that preserves some recognizable aspect. Or maybe a volley would be returned with another program that uses some part of the prior volley as input, or produces some part of it as output.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to say that there should be no additional rules, in order to maximize creative liberties. However, we might want to impose an additional constraint that the result be runnable. We also might want to forbid loadable resources that were not created within the time budget.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult question would be whether or not to allow libraries: allowing them would open the door to leveraging vast quantities of effort expended prior to the match, and forbidding them would open a difficult question of exactly what constitutes part of a standard acceptable library – for certainly there&rsquo;s not much that can be done with exactly zero library functions. Another good question is whether we have to restrict ourselves to a single language and environment. Could a volley written as a Haskell program on FreeBSD be returned by volley in SceneKit on MacOS X that animates the tokens from the <code>.hs</code> source?</p>

<p>As I imagine what it might be like to participate in such an event, I find the most terrifying rule to be the 15-minute time limit. The results would likely be much less impressive than the images in Layer Tennis. Expect the match to look nothing like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_scene">demo scene</a>. Instead, expect something closer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">Fizz Buzz</a> end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m playing, that is. I would love to see what some of the more talented hackers could do under such tight pressure.</p>

<p>The programming world does already have at least one game that we play out in the open, but it lacks the dueling banjos appeal of Layer Tennis. I&rsquo;m thinking of Code Golf, of course, which can produce <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/35569/tweetable-mathematical-art">impressive and entertaining results</a> in a short amount of time. (Follow that last link and compare the dates of some of the answers to how long ago the question was asked.) But even here we have no idea how many hours of thought and coding happened prior to the question being asked.</p>

<p>Code Golf has a different kind of constraint: how terse can your code be? The challenge in the last paragraph, for example, is wondering what could fit within a Tweet. It doesn&rsquo;t care if my submission comes after a month of late-night hacking.</p>

<p>The programming world also has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest">programming</a> <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">contests</a>, but even those provide several hours for the contestants to hack. Moreover, they are given a fixed set of problems to solve, which squelches creativity.</p>

<p>Code Pong, as I am imagining it, may not even be possible. Layer Tennis, to use music as metaphor, is more like improvisational performance, whereas programming is more like composition, where short bursts in the psychological state of flow yield more modest fruit. Still, it might be interesting to try.</p>
